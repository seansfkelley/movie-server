watch folders for changes (https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar)

create simple web site that I can run through http-server

use bower for some simple hardcoded dependencies

pretty much just slam everything (data, libs) into the page so the client can deal with compiling it

for browser-facing stuff:
- search-as-you-type
- last-rendered date
- totally statically served (if possible with js resources)
- include somewhere filenames that failed to parse
